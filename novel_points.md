1. The **Rumor Leakage** Quantification ($t < 0$)

Most studies assume reaction starts after the news. We are hypothesizing that DC Inside has "insider info" or leaks.

We can statistically prove the existence of "Pre-news signals."

Let's say we find a statistically significant spike in keyword volume or negative sentiment at $t = -3 \text{ hours}$, then we show that DC Inside precedes mainstream media.

How many standard deviations above the baseline was the volume before the news dropped?

2. The **Sentiment Hysteresis**. "Hysteresis" is when a system changes due to a force but does not return to its original state after the force is removed.

We might find that while the Volume decays quickly (news becomes old), the Sentiment remains permanently lower than the baseline.

Example: Before dating news: 50 posts/day, 80% positive.

Peak Scandal: 5000 posts/day, 10% positive.

1 Month Later: back to 50 posts/day, but only 40% positive.

Conclusion: The scandal didn't just pass, it permanently damaged the community's "baseline affection" even after they stopped shouting about it.

3.  The **Emotion Velocity** comparision

We can compare the speed of different variables. For instance, does "Anger" travel faster than "Celebration"?
