1. The "Rumor Leakage" Quantification ($t < 0$)Most studies assume reaction starts after the news. You are hypothesizing that DC Inside has "insider info" or leaks.The Novelty: You can statistically prove the existence of "Pre-News Signals."The Finding: If you find a statistically significant spike in keyword volume or negative sentiment at $t = -2 \text{ hours}$ (or $-1 \text{ day}$), you prove that DC Inside acts as a "Rumor Mill" that precedes mainstream media.Metric: "Pre-cursor Anomaly Strength" — How many standard deviations above the baseline was the volume before the news dropped?

2. The "Sentiment-Volume Hysteresis" (The Grudge Effect)In physics/economics, "hysteresis" is when a system changes due to a force but does not return to its original state after the force is removed.The Novelty: Most people assume that when the volume of posts goes down (people stop talking), the sentiment returns to normal. You can challenge this.The Finding: You might find that while the Volume decays quickly (news becomes old), the Sentiment remains permanently lower than the baseline.Example: Before dating news: 50 posts/day, 80% positive.Peak Scandal: 5000 posts/day, 10% positive.1 Month Later: 50 posts/day, but only 40% positive.Conclusion: The scandal didn't just "pass"; it permanently damaged the community's "baseline affection" even after they stopped shouting about it.

3. The "Reaction Velocity" Delta (Anger vs. Interest)You can compare the speed of different variables.The Novelty: Does "Anger" travel faster than "Interest"?The Analysis: Compare the time it takes to reach Peak Volume ($T_{vol}$) vs. Peak Negative Sentiment ($T_{neg}$).Hypothesis:If $T_{neg} < T_{vol}$ (Peak negativity hits before peak traffic): The "Core Users" (aggregators) react instantly with hate, framing the narrative before the general public (traffic) even arrives.If $T_{neg} > T_{vol}$ (Peak negativity hits after peak traffic): The initial reaction is shock/confusion, and "Hate" is a manufactured sentiment that grows over time as users radicalize each other.
